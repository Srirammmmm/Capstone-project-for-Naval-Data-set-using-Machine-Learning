This repository contains the code and resources for a Machine Learning project focused on analyzing and predicting features related to naval vessels. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about various naval vessels, and machine learning techniques are applied for data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information such as vessel type, dimensions, displacement, engine power, and other relevant features. The goal is to explore patterns within the data and develop machine learning models for tasks such as classification or regression.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Jupyter notebooks and scripts for exploring the naval vessel dataset, understanding the distribution of features, and gaining insights.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Code for cleaning and transforming the dataset to prepare it for machine learning tasks.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of machine learning models for tasks like classification or regression. Common algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks may be explored.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
